          - Consider DBC's culture and approach to learning</br>
          - Predict how you will react to DBC's approach</br>
          - Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>

          After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video, my take on the DBC experience is that it is as advertised. The reason I chose DBC over the other coding academies was the holistic approach DBC takes towards teaching the material. I definitely got a taste of that during this first week and look forward to getting more.

          I see myself able to fully getting into the DBC culture, I feel I am at my best when I am surrounded by bright and ambitious people. As an introvert, I will have to get use to using social media as the primary means of interacting with my cohort during phase 0. My expectations of DBC have remained the same, which is to learn as much as I can over the next 18 weeks. I am nervous about how much information I will be able to master, but I am excited to see just how much I can learn at the end of DBC.
