          - Consider how I can use my understanding of my thinking style to my advantage at DBC to help me learn.</br>
          - Reflect on my experience in Phase 0 to this point.</br>
          - Growth vs Fixed mindset <br>

          After finding out I was a <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">concrete sequential</a>, I knew that working remote during phase 0 was going to be a challenge. However, all was not lost. The week by week progression of topics and challenges so far makes perfect sense, and I have had some nice pairing sessions with other members of my cohort. While the progressions of topics fits nicely with my learning style, I feel I should be delving deeper in all the topics we learn each week.

          Phase 0 has been fun so far. Not only have I learned alot, I got to learn a variety of topics that actually fit together, such as HTML and CSS, Git and version control, etc. The only struggle so far has been my motivation versus my action. My goal has been to finish the week's challenges well in advance, but I always put off some of the challenges I do not enjoy as much, such as blogging : ). I mean what is the deal with twitting out our blogs, can't an introvert just pour out his thoughts onto the internet privately?

          Now that I have digressed enough to add more text (and more soul) into this post, I'm going to go over how I plan on using a <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">growth mindset</a> to get over my struggles. I think the key is to have fun while writing these blogs. Instead of writing the dry to-the-point posts I have written so far, I'll add more of what I find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">fun</a> to make the process of writing more enjoyable. I hope that you would find them more enjoyable to read as well.
