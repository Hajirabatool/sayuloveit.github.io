          The technology industry, just like any other industry, faces a host of problems. The problems range from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0">sexism</a> to security. I think the biggest problem facing the tech industry is the lack of education that can support the ever growing tech sector.

          There are a variety of views debating how to address the lack of certain talents in tech. The views vary from <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB130650430883419575">not having enough talent around</a> to <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/05/13/americas-tech-talent-shortage-is-it-just-myth/">what talent shortage</a>? The summary of those views are tech companies are fighting over tech talents by offering ridiculous salaries and perks. Some companies are outsourcing jobs overseas to fufill their need for talent. I think the problem seems very reasonable. There is not enough tech talent because schools are not teaching tech in depth and it takes years for someone to build up the expertise needed for the job. Furthermore, since there is so much variety in tech, experts in certain areas are hard to find.

          While I think alot of the debate are only referring to top or niche tech talents that are indeed rare to find, I do think that schools need to do more to emphasize tech. For examples, every school should at least offer some sort of programming class to introduce students to progamming. However, I think the numerous coding schools that have popped up over recent years are helping to alleviate this issue. I think coding schools provide a great introduction for people who want to get into the tech industry and I am curious to see how this new part of the education industry play out.
