          Pairing to solve challanges have been very interesting. I was able to learn something new outside of the scope of the challenge everytime, and that to me is the most important part about pairing. I also enjoyed getting to interact with memebers of my cohort, some of which are not going to be in NYC with me during the onsite. Overall I really enjoy pair programming, although I would prefer to do it in person instead of online of given the choice.

          Reading the feedbacks having been humbling. I was glad to read feedback that pointed out bad habits I have developed or positive things I should keep doing. I need to work on asking more questions during guided pairing sessions to take advantage of the guide being there. I honestly have a hard time giving constructive feedback to my pairs as I thought they were all great.

          I think pairing and feedback has supplemented each week's learnings from the challenges' well. Pairing and feedback gives us chances to work on and improve our soft skills which are not easy skills to develop. I also enjoyed getting to work with new people each week and getting to know them before the onsite starts.
