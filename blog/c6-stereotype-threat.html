          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">Wikipedia</a> defines streotype threat as "a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group." I don't believe there is a universal way to deal with sterotypes. Each person will be associated with a set of sterotypes and each of those set of sterotypes have to be dealt with individually. Of course, some people's set of sterotypes will be much larger than others, but each person will be sterotyped one way or another. Being sterotyped is unavoidable.

          As a person of color who experienced his share of sterotypes, I believe the best way to overcome them is to not let your sterotypes get to you. I know that is a completely generic answer that sounds like a cop-out, but there's no way around it. In my opinion, there's no reason to let sterotypes dictate my actions. Sure, sterotypes may make some of my actions alot harder, such as when I was trying out for the football team in high school and got laughed at by some people. But if I let sterotypes affect me back then, I would have never made a sack that kept our lead and won my school's homecoming game.

          The sterotype threat is very real, but people cannot let their sterotypes dictate their actions. While I truly believe overcoming one's sterotypes is a personal endeavor, everyone can contribute to the effort not imposing sterotypes to each other. Sterotypes only have power if we impose it on each over.
