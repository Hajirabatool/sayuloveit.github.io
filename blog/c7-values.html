          - One value to rule them all</br>
          - Values and Stereotype threat</br>
          <br>

        <p>
          Commitment is important to me because having none means having no goals, having no goals means no growth, having no growth means you are dead. Yes, that escalated quickly. On a serious note, to me commitment means having goals to strive for. Having goals to strive for is how I grow. My commitments vary from brushing my teeth before I go to bed each night to becoming a fullstack developer.

          Thinking about my values makes me more determined to reach my goals, which in turn will help me overcome any stereotype threat I recognize myself falling into. I want to go to bed each night knowing I have advanced at least one of my goals in some way. I know it'll take a long time to become a good fullstack developer, but I'll enjoy each day of the journey that'll take me there.
