          One of the conflict I had in the past was about keeping the kitchen clean. I was living with two other guys, while none of us were the cleaniest people, one person would let dirty dishes pile up for weeks before washing them. Initally, my approach was to clean my dishes as an example, but that did not have any effect. I felt frustrated and disgusted by the amount of dishes that were piling up. I finally just asked the guy to clean the dishes. The habit of leaving dishes out continued, they were cleaned up in a timely manner after I would ask for the person to clean them. In hindsight, I should have explained why I did not like dishes piling up as I thought the reasons would have been obvious, but I should have attempted to explain why I thought keeping the kitchen clean was important. I learned to confront problems right away instead of dragging things out.
