        <p>
          I believe the most important thing when asking for questions if to provide context. For example, if I were to ask for a pair for a pairing challenge on our cohort google+ group, I should provide the name of the challenge, times that work best for me, and what time zone I am in. Filling in the context will be even more vital when asking technical questions. If I were to run into a bug I can't figure out, not only should I provide the given error, I should also provide where in the code I suspect the error is coming from. Furthermore, it would also be helpful to state my intent for what the code should accomplish. However, questions should be concise, there is no need to tell the story of your whole project. Now go and ask more questions.
