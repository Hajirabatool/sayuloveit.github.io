          Version control is simply the process of keeping track of the changes one makes to the code. It is like keeping copies (versions) of the code at various check points during development. Why would anyone want to keep track of changes to a code base? Why would anyone not want the latest and greatest version of the code? To answer the first question, keeping track of changes to the code allows for developers to check the progress they are making. Developers can check the changes to the code to see what features they have added or what problems they have fixed. The answer to the second question is a bit situational. One situation may be that the developer have given a customer a customized version of the code to suit that customer's needs. In that case, the customer would require a specific code base that the lastest version of the code cannot provide. Another situation might be there may be some nasty bug that made it through testing into the latest version, and the developer has to go back to an earlier version to diagnose and compare the issue. There are many different situations where version control is needed, but there is always a need to keep track of various versions of the code.

          One of the tools for version control Git. Git is a command line tool that helps one keep track of changes. Git keeps track everytime a file changes. Git then allows one to save each change as a "commit" and write a message about what changes were made. The user can then look through all the changes they've made and even revert back to those changes.

        <p>
          Since Git only allow one to use version control on their personal computer, it is not very helpful when several people are working on the same code on many computers. GitHub solves this issue by providing online storage for one to store their code. The user can upload their code (and all the changes) up to GitHub, where it can then be downloaded by anyone with an internet access, who can then also work on the code and upload their own changes. Storing code on GitHub allows for instant collaboration and allows each developer to share their code with the world.
