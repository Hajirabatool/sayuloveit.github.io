        <p>
          Making classes in Ruby goes like the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        class Person
          attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

          def initialize(first_name, last_name)
            @first_name = first_name
            @last_name = last_name
          end

          def full_name
            @first_name + " " + @last_name
          end
        end
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Making the above equivalent in JavaScript goes like the following:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
        function Person(first_name, last_name) {
          this.first_name = first_name
          this.last_name = last_name

          this.full_name = function() {
            return this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name
          }
        }
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Both of versions of "Person" will need two arguments (first name and last name)to instantiate a new object. Both have a "full_name" method where the first and last name will be returned. As you can see the "function" syntex of JavaScript works like "def" in Ruby, and the "this" keyword in JavaScript is the equivalent to the "self" keyword in Ruby. Having just started learning JavaScript this week, the only differences I'm seeing so far has been syntax. I'm sure as I dive deeper into both, I'll begin to notice the differences in how the two languages work under the hood.
