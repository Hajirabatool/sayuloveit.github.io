          Dynamically typed languanges means the type of the variables in the code is interpreted at run time. A variable name in dynamically typed languanges are only bound to an object. Examples of dynamically typed languanges are Ruby and Python.

        <p>
          Statically typed languages means the type of variables in the code need to be specified, and are verified at compile time. A variable name in statically typed languanges are bound to an object and type. Examples of statically tyoed languanges are Java and C++.
        </p>

        <p>
          The advantage of dynamically typed languanges is the flexibility of not having to specify the variable's type, which in turn implies faster feedback, turn-around time, and development speed. But not specifiying variable type can also be an disadvantage as data can be inadvertently converted to the wrong type, resulting in harder to find bugs.
